# Engineering Style Guide

The purpose of this repository is to

- have the Vercel Engineering Style Guide in ESLint 9 native flat config as most
  dependencies already support it
- minimize use of compatibility layer only to the few packages without flat
  config support
- optimize performance of IDE extensions
- keep the dependencies up to date
- add or customize the rules
